 - incremental datafetch along with scrolling or more button <- speedup website
 - Multimedia posting <- feature addition
 - âœ… Google Signin issue in mobile and github.io <- bug/feature addition
    : the redirect link issue, firebase allows only localhost and it's provided
      link as allowed redirects for oauth. Can setup personal domain too, but not 
      github.io or heroku.com

 Login failing in github and heroku because their redirect uri are not registered with Google
